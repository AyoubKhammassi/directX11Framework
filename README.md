# directX11Framework

A basic DirectX11 setup to draw something primirive on the window. 
Win32 is used for the main window where the application draws.
If you run the project you'll see rotating cubes without any lighting. You can play around with the code to change what it renders by
modifying the Draw function in Graphics.cpp or by changing the pixel and vertex shaders.
